      <p>I was born on January 22, making me an Aquarius. I was raised in Long Beach, CA for the majority of my life.
      It wasn't until October 2019 that I decided to move to South Central, CA to try my hand at living in Los Angeles. So far, 
      I'm enjoying living outside of my home town.
    </p>

    <p>I started as a photographer Febuaray 2019 and have been taking pictures ever since. I managed to shoot my first wedding, 
      take graduation photos, maternity pictures, a lot of portrait shots, and this month I will be shooting my first product shots.
    </p>

    <p>How did I come across this coding bootcamp? I told my boyfriend I needed another part time job and he suggested I become
      a coder. I love challenging myself and learning new things so I was super interested. Coding is hard, but I am enjoiing
      the challenge... kind of. I am honestly looking forward to working for a well paying company and showcasing my creativity
      in a new field. </p>
